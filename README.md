# mkcommit

## Why?

### `commitlint` exists. Why `mkcommit`?

`commitlint` is a great tool. But it's also a bit bloated in my opinion and I didn't find it enjoyable to use. I wanted something that I can install within seconds on any machine, load static configuration within seconds and quickly create messages from predefined templates. Hence I decided to make one myself.

I mean, come on. Not only do I have to know how to configure and use code linters, CI servers, static code analysis tools, test automation tools like `tox` or `nox`, now I need to learn a fairly complex tool just to get my commit messages in order? I don't have time for that and I bet neither do you.
